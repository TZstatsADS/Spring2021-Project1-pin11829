### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Money Wars in Election
+ This project is conducted by **Pin-Chun Chen**

+ Project summary: Money occupies a significant part of people’s lives, and it is also closely related to national policies. If you can make more money for the people, you have a better chance of earning everyone’s votes. Therefore, we will use the ANES dataset to delve into this topic by solving the following three questions: 
1. The annual income distribution of the American family?
2. According to different financial conditions, which candidate and political party they will vote?
3. How to use economic policies to change people’s preference?
